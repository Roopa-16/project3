# StyleFish

StyleFish is a MERN-stack application for folks who want to up their fashion game. Sign up, pick a starter clothing item, and StyleFish will generate an outfit that you can then save to your closet. Check out other users' closets and save them to your own closet.

## Technologies used

- MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, Node)
- JWT
- Socket.io
- MDB (Bootstrap UI Kit and Animations)

## Starting the app lo

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
